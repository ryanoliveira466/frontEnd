### The Formula:
```javascript
const scrollPercentage = (scrollY) / (documentHeight - windowHeight);
```

### Key Components:
1. **`scrollY`**: This is the amount you've scrolled down on the page. It gives you the distance (in pixels) from the top of the page to your current scroll position. If you're at the top of the page, `scrollY` will be `0`. As you scroll down, this value increases.

2. **`documentHeight`**: This is the **total height** of the page, including both the visible part (what you can see) and the hidden part (what you need to scroll to see). This is the full height of all your contentâ€”think of it as the "size" of the entire page.

3. **`windowHeight`**: This is the height of the **visible part** of the browser window (also called the viewport). It's the area of the page you can actually see without scrolling. If your window is 800px tall, `windowHeight` will be 800.

### Explanation of the Formula:

The goal of this formula is to calculate **how far the user has scrolled down** the page as a **percentage** of the total scrollable distance. This helps us determine how much of the path should be drawn based on the scroll position.

#### **Step-by-step Breakdown:**

1. **The total scrollable area** is the total height of the document minus the height of the window:
   ```javascript
   documentHeight - windowHeight
   ```
   This represents the **scrollable distance**. It's the space you can scroll through, starting from the top and going all the way to the bottom of the page.

2. **The current scroll position** is how far you've scrolled from the top, represented by `scrollY`.

3. Now, to get the percentage of how much you've scrolled, we divide the **current scroll position** by the **total scrollable distance**:
   ```javascript
   scrollPercentage = (scrollY) / (documentHeight - windowHeight)
   ```

   This tells us what fraction of the page you've scrolled through. For example:
   - If you're at the very top of the page (`scrollY = 0`), the percentage will be `0`, meaning the path hasn't started drawing.
   - If you're at the bottom of the page (i.e., you've scrolled the entire height of the page), the percentage will be `1`, meaning the entire path is drawn.

### Example:

Let's say the following:
- `documentHeight = 2000px` (the total height of the page)
- `windowHeight = 800px` (the height of the visible area of the page)
- `scrollY = 400px` (you've scrolled down 400 pixels)

Now, calculate the **total scrollable distance**:
```javascript
documentHeight - windowHeight = 2000px - 800px = 1200px
```

Then, calculate the **scroll percentage**:
```javascript
scrollPercentage = 400px / 1200px = 0.33
```

So, you've scrolled **33%** of the total scrollable area. This value is a fraction between `0` (top) and `1` (bottom). It represents how far you've scrolled relative to the total scrollable area.

### Do You Need to Understand Math?

Not really! The formula is simple and easy to follow:

1. **`scrollY`** gives you how far youâ€™ve scrolled.
2. **`documentHeight - windowHeight`** gives you the total scrollable space.
3. **Dividing** them gives you a percentage of how far you've scrolled.

You don't need to worry about heavy math here; you're just dividing two numbers to get a percentage value!

### Why is this useful for animating based on scroll?

By calculating the scroll percentage, we can use it to determine how much of the SVG path should be drawn or how much it should be hidden. Since the percentage will range from 0 (top of the page) to 1 (bottom of the page), we can directly use it to animate the drawing of the SVG path.

For example:
- At `scrollPercentage = 0`, the path is completely hidden (not drawn).
- At `scrollPercentage = 1`, the path is fully drawn.
- Any value between 0 and 1 means the path is partially drawn, in proportion to the scroll position.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Formula**: `scrollPercentage = (scrollY) / (documentHeight - windowHeight)`
- **What it does**: It calculates the fraction (percentage) of the page you've scrolled, which is useful for triggering animations based on scroll position.
- **No heavy math needed**: Just basic division to get a percentage!
